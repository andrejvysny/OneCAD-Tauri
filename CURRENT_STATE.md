# OneCAD-Tauri — Current State (2026-07-19)

Non-destructive migration of OneCAD-CPP (~69k LOC C++20 Qt6+OCCT) into a 4-layer
Tauri app per NEW_SPEC.md. Tracker: `TODO.md` (per-WP gates + flags). OneCAD-CPP
stays untouched.

## Milestone status

| Milestone | Status |
|---|---|
| M0 foundations (protocol contract, scaffolds, corpus) | DONE |
| M1 cores (Rust document/history/regen/io · C++ worker OCCT+solver · frontend slice) | DONE |
| M2 first micro-slice integration gate | **PASS** (`m2_gate.rs` vs real worker) |
| M2-R implementation review | DONE — systemic BodyId wire-form defect found+fixed, `wire_contract.rs` regression gate, independent review APPROVE |
| M3 packaging gate | Linux portion DONE (externalBin deb-verified, path chain, bundle-dylibs.sh, PACKAGING.md); **Mac-side verification DEFERRED** (checklist §5) |
| FX file/app UX | DONE — save/open/recents/STEP-export UI, worker-status, live constraints |
| **M4 topology slice (backend + repair UI)** | **DONE, review-closed** (H5-B proven vs real worker) |
| **M5 lifecycle** (Revolve tool, STL/OBJ, checkpoints, splits, autosave+recovery, onecad-regen CLI, crash drills, drift gate) | **DONE** |
| M6 hardening + backlog | Shell+Patterns+Mirror + sketch parity (snaps, autoconstrain, Dimension) DONE; remaining: datum, Loft/Sweep, Playwright e2e, perf |

## What works end-to-end (real worker, automated gates)
Sketch (PlaneGCS, dof) → regions → extrude (multi-region by normative FNV id;
stale id fails loudly, never a silent wrong profile) → booleans/pocket/ToFace
(wire_contract volumes exact) → MESH1 → pick → ElementId promotion (stable,
Invariant 1) → fillet via scored ladder → **parametric edit → auto-rebind
(fillet survives) or deterministic NeedsRepair — the H5-B fix the corpus
documents as the legacy app's unfixed defect** (`topology_rebind.rs`) → repair
UI (banner → panel → score-ranked candidates → click-to-rebind via
promote + EditOperationInput) → save v2 container → reopen → deterministic
replay → STEP export → undo. Plus: Revolve tool (axis-pick + angle drag +
lathe preview), file menu (⌘O/⌘S/⇧⌘S/Export STEP), recents, worker-status
surfacing, history suppress/roll/delete affordances, solver-position
hydration on sketch re-entry.

## Suites (all green, orchestrator-verified)
- Worker: 61/61 ctests (OCCT 7.9.3; breadth ops m6a_ops incl.)
- Rust: 379 tests, clippy -D warnings + fmt clean (chaos 14, real-worker 5,
  m2_gate 2, wire_contract 8, topology_rebind 5, breadth_ops 6, checkpoints, regen CLI — vs real binary;
  ONECAD_REQUIRE_WORKER=1 guard in CI prevents vacuous greens)
- Frontend: 559 vitest, build green, hex-token gate 0

## Architecture decisions log (D-series + session additions)
- D1: NewBody BodyIds worker-minted `body_<opId>`, Rust adopts+fences
- D2: STEP export in worker · D3: `primary.topoKey` removed · D4: fencing =
  workerEpoch+expectedBaseHash only · D5: from-0 plans always base-valid
- Hash authority: Rust sole; planner hash decoupled from wire form (golden-pinned)
- Wire body form: ALL body-bearing params render `body_<uuid>` at the wire layer
  (core serde frozen); `intent` subtrees round-trip verbatim (never rewritten)
- Region binding: non-empty regionId MUST match (OP_FAILED naming available ids);
  empty = first-region V1 fallback; legacy ids sanitized on load (migrate diagnostic)
- AutoBind: elementId slot carries the Rust-minted id; topoKey is evidence (§9)
- Ladder policy: auto-bind ≥0.85 AND margin ≥0.10; symmetric tie ⇒ NeedsRepair;
  a fillet consumes its edge — re-resolving it NeedsRepairs (autoBind there = mis-bind)

## Key flags / known gaps
- Mac packaging verification (signing/notarization/bundle-dylibs first run) — needs a Mac
- L2 exact preview still local (no backend preview verb); revolve L1 only
- Checkpoints live (save-on-explicit-save policy, in-session restore V1; restore-fallback D1 edge flagged in TODO)
- Autosave+recovery live (30s debounce, startup-only recovery V1); onecad-regen CLI in CI
- Repair UI seams: resolveRefs sends refId-only; >1-body operated-body derivation;
  candidate viewport highlight = data seam; suppressed flag = optimistic overlay
- STEP import stub; Loft/Sweep UNSUPPORTED at worker (Shell/Patterns/Mirror LIVE end-to-end)
- Env note: Linux dev container uses conda-forge OCCT 7.9.3 at /opt/occt793
  (apt 7.6.3 too old); CI = macos-14 + Homebrew

## Conventions
- Orchestrator (Fable) designs/briefs/reviews; WPs → Opus subagents; RISKY WPs
  get independent adversarial review; commits at gate boundaries only
- protocol/SCHEMA changes need sign-off + §14 changelog (+ fixture bump if shapes move)
- Worker binary for tests: `ONECAD_WORKER_PATH=worker/build/onecad-worker`
